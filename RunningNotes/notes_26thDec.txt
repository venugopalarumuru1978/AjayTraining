Overriding  :-  Replacement features to the existing unit. 

Method Overriding:- 
Overriding is a feature that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its super-classes or parent classes.

1. Both parent and child classes should have same name and counting of methods including parameters. 
2. First Create an object for the parent class then call the methods of the parent class. 
3. Now create an object for the child class then assign that object to the parent class object. (overriding)
