Exception Handling
--------------
Errors are 3 types

1. Compile Time Errors :-  At the time of compilation / before executing program
				any errors occurs, those are compile time.
2. Run Time Errors :-    At the time of execution any error occurs, those are runtime errors.
				To handle run-time errors, exception handling can be used.
3. Logical Errors :-    Any Loigc Mistake in a code. 
------------------------------------
Exception :- It is an abnormal situtation generated at the time of program execution.

Exception Handling :-  the process of handling the run-time errors/exceptions. it will provide following keywords

try		:-  this block allows to detect any errors at the time of execution, if it found it will send to 
				catch block.  
catch		:- This block allow execute when try block gets an exception.

	try
	{
		actual code
	}
	catch(ExceptionName Obj)
	{
		alternative code
	}

Exception is a parent class which can be used to solve any exception in the program as well as all other exception classes are child classes of Exception parent class.
finally		:- This block will get executed when irrespective of exception. 
	try
	{
		actual code
	}
	catch(ExceptionName Obj)
	{
		alternative code
	}
	finally
	{
		code must execute
	}


Exceptions are classified 3 types

Unchecked  :-   these are not identified by the compiler at the time of compilation. To handle these exceptions
			try - catch blocks are used. 

Checked	   :-   these are identified by the compiler before execution / at the time of coding.
				by using "throws" keyword these exceptions can be handled.

		void MethodName(....) throws <exception_name>{
			code
		}
User Defined :-  these are created by the user and handled by the user. 
			to raise an exception "throw" can be used.

			throw  new ExceptionName(.....)
