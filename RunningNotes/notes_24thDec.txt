Static Members:- 
----------------
class, object, methods, constructor, getter and setter.

Class members are classified into two types

1.  Non-Static Members :-  these are used to make multiple copies of data. So that every member binded with an object
2.  Static Members :-  

these are used to make single of copy of data, so that these are binded with class. i.e. it uses class memory.

points :- 

1.  These are used to declare / define with "static" keyword.
2.  Static Methods can handle only static variables of the class whereas non-static method can handle both static and non-static variables. 
3.  Static methods can be called with the help of class. 
-----------------------------------------------
Inheritance :- 

the process of getting features from one class to another specific class. purpose of the inheritance is re-usablity of the class. 

here First Class is called Base/parent/super class and second class is called derived/child/sub class.
inheritance always happend from parent to child class. 

To inherit parent to class child class, "extends" keyword is used. 

As per inheritance, just create an object for child classes then call methods of parent and child classes.
