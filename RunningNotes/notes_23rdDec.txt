OOPS Concepts
-------------
OOPS :-  Object Oriented Programing Structure.

It is a Programming architecture  to provide security for the data.
here programming lang which we are using called as object oriented programming languages.
C++, Java, C#.Net,....

Object
Class
Abstraction
Encapulation
Inheritance
Polymarphisum
----------
Object :-  It is a thing in the real world which has some attributes and functionalities. 

		Example :-  Car is an Object
				Attributes :-  Color, Model, Capacity, Company, .....
				Functionality :-  Transportation, Engine Start, Changing Gears, Using Breaks, ..

Object are not natural entities of the world, these are instances of their parent units. 

Class :- It is a blue print for the object. 
			or
	It is an encapuslated cell which is used to define attributes and functionalites of the object. 


Syntax :- 

class <class name>
{
	Variables (Data Members)
	Methods  (Member Functions - user defined functions)
}


Data Members :-  These are the variables where data can be stored. These are also called as Instance variables. 
Member Functions :-  These are the user defined function where data members can be manipulated. 

class Demo
{
	int x,y;

	void getData()
	{
		x = 10;
		y = 20;
	}

	void putData()
	{
		int sum = x+y;
		SOP(x);
		SOP(y);
		SOP(sum);
	}
}

Object :-  It is an instance of the class. 

<ClassName>  <object>  =new <ClassName>([para meters]);

Demo   d1 = new Demo();
Once object is created, we can access class members with the help of object as follows

	ObjectName.MemberName

	d1.getData();
	d1.putData();

Object of the class will be created either outside the class(i.e. in another class) or inside the  class
when it is having main() method. 

//  Create a class Employee, where it should take empname, job,salary then calculate
//  10% comm and netsalary(sal+comm). 
//  create it for 3 employees
---------------------------------------------------
constructor :- It is a special method, it has same name of class. 

purpose :-   to provide initial task for the object. i.e. initilization of the instance variables. 

Points :- 

1.  It will execute automatically whenever we create an object. 
2.  It can take parameters, for that parameters, values can be passed at the time of object creation. 
3.  A class can have multiple constructors, but each constructor should have diff no of parameters. 
-----------------------
Access Specifiers :-   these are the keywords which allows to specify how to access class members. 

private  :-  only inside the class
public   :-  inside and outside of the class
protected :-  from specific class to another specific class.(inheritance)

by default class members are public. 
----------------------------
getters and setters :- these are special methods which can be used to access a class private variable into outside of the class. 

setter methods are used to assign value to the variable.
getter methods are used to return value from variable.


class abc
{

private int x;
private float y;

void setX(int x)
{
this.x = x;
}

int getX()
{
return x;
}


void setY(float y)
{
this.y = y;
}

float getY()
{
return y;
}

}
